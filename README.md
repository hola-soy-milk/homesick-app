homesick-app
============

This is the client side to my bachelor project, Homesick.

What the Android app does is it records audio, sends it off to the Homesick app server, and receives a response with a sound to be played depending on how the server classifies the former.

This repo currently holds a test activity, where I taught myself to record, store and and play back audio in the 3gp format, with the help of the [official Android API docs](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/audio-capture.html).

In the future, this will send the recorded audio to the [Homesick server](https://github.com/ramonh/homesick-server).
